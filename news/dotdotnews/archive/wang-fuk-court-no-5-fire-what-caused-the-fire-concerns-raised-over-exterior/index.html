Police have arrested three responsible individuals from the engineering company involved and are conducting evidence collection today at the\xA0Laurels Industrial Centre in Wong Tai Sin.<\/p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Safety of exterior wall materials under scrutiny, Chris Tang: Investigation to proceed \x1Dalong criminal lines<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Secretary for Security Chris Tang stated that during firefighting and rescue operations, firefighters observed that the exterior wall materials of the affected building, including protective nets, protective films, waterproof tarps, and plastic sheets, <strong>exhibited an unusually rapid and intense fire spread<\/strong> compared to compliant materials. Tang described the situation as abnormal.<\/p> \n<p>Additionally, f<strong>irefighters discovered so-called \"foam boards\"<\/strong> affixed to the glass windows of an unaffected building nearby. These foam boards were highly flammable and prone to exacerbating fire spread when exposed to heat, which was also deemed unusual. Authorities will conduct an in-depth investigation into these two abnormalities.<\/p> \n<p>Tang further noted that the police and fire services have formed a joint task force to investigate not only the cause of the fire but also to <strong>pursue the matter from a criminal perspective<\/strong>.<\/p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Non-flame-retardant scaffold nets potentially a key factor, dry weather also contributed to fire severity<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Chau Sze-kit, Chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, analyzed that based on the current situation and reports, the fire likely originated from the ignition of scaffold nets, triggering a chain reaction. The bamboo scaffolding itself also caught fire, causing the blaze to escalate rapidly. He suggested that the final conclusion would depend on investigations by the Fire Services Department and the police.<\/p> \n<p>Chau explained that compliant flame-retardant scaffold nets are designed to effectively slow fire spread. However, <strong>he speculated that the nets used in this incident were either non-flame-retardant or had lost their flame-retardant properties.<\/strong> He also pointed out that <strong>construction waste or flammable materials stored on the scaffolding could have contributed to the severity of the No. 5 alarm fire<\/strong>.<\/p> \n<p>Some experts also attributed the fire\'s intensity to the dry weather and strong winds, which further fueled the flames.<\/p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Industry highlights regulatory loopholes, cost considerations may influence material choices<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Ho Ping-tak, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union,\xA0expressed concern over whether flame-retardant nets were used on the exterior walls of the building. Speaking on a radio program today, Ho noted that <strong>flame-retardant nets are more expensive than standard non-flame-retardant nets, and it is possible that some individuals prioritized cost savings over safety regulations<\/strong>. He called on the government to strengthen oversight.<\/p> \n<p>Ho also pointed out that scaffolding was erected simultaneously across seven buildings, which allowed the fire to spread more easily. Additionally, he criticized the construction project for lasting over a year, which he deemed excessively long, adding that the consultancy firm overseeing the maintenance should bear responsibility.<\/p> \n<p>Lee\xA0Kwong-sing, Chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner, stated that <strong>while the Labour Department\'s industry guidelines recommend the use of flame-retardant nets, there is no legal requirement mandating their use.<\/strong> This regulatory gap fosters a sense of complacency within the industry. Lee shared that he has encountered construction sites using fishing nets as protective barriers.<\/p> \n<p>He also condemned <strong>the use of foam boards to seal ventilation openings<\/strong> in this incident, describing it as a grave mistake. Lee speculated that workers likely used the boards to prevent dust from entering indoor spaces, but emphasized that foam boards are highly flammable and pose a significant fire hazard. He criticized the lack of safety awareness among workers.<\/p> \n<p>Furthermore, Lee noted that maintenance sites often <strong>lack safety officers to oversee operations and do not enforce smoking bans<\/strong>. He observed that some workers smoke while working, underscoring the insufficiency of government and industry oversight.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Related News:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202511/27/AP6927acebe4b0c32d4f607a76.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Watch This) Tai Po No. 5 fire | Death toll rises to 44 as rescue efforts continue<\/a><\/strong><\/p> \n<p><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202511/27/AP6927b28ce4b0c32d4f607d57.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch This | Current situation at Wang Fuk Court: Fire flashes emerge in central of building<\/a><\/strong><\/p>','contentType':0,'created':'2025-11-27T14:01:02.080+08:00','createdBy':'system','description':'A No. 5 alarm fire broke out yesterday (Nov. 26) at\xA0Wang Fuk Court\xA0in Tai Po.

<p>A No. 5 alarm fire broke out yesterday (Nov. 26) at&nbsp;Wang Fuk Court&nbsp;in Tai Po. As of today (Nov. 27), the fire has caused at least 44 fatalities and left 45 people in critical condition, with 7 firefighters injured during rescue operations. The fire started at 2:51 p.m. yesterday and quickly escalated from a No. 3 alarm fire to No. 5. As of this morning, firefighters are still engaged in extinguishing the fire and carrying out aftermath work. Police have arrested three responsible individuals from the engineering company involved and are conducting evidence collection today at the&nbsp;Laurels Industrial Centre in Wong Tai Sin.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Safety of exterior wall materials under scrutiny, Chris Tang: Investigation to proceed along criminal lines</strong></p> 
<p>Secretary for Security Chris Tang stated that during firefighting and rescue operations, firefighters observed that the exterior wall materials of the affected building, including protective nets, protective films, waterproof tarps, and plastic sheets, <strong>exhibited an unusually rapid and intense fire spread</strong> compared to compliant materials. Tang described the situation as abnormal.</p> 
<p>Additionally, f<strong>irefighters discovered so-called "foam boards"</strong> affixed to the glass windows of an unaffected building nearby. These foam boards were highly flammable and prone to exacerbating fire spread when exposed to heat, which was also deemed unusual. Authorities will conduct an in-depth investigation into these two abnormalities.</p> 
<p>Tang further noted that the police and fire services have formed a joint task force to investigate not only the cause of the fire but also to <strong>pursue the matter from a criminal perspective</strong>.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Non-flame-retardant scaffold nets potentially a key factor, dry weather also contributed to fire severity</strong></p> 
<p>Chau Sze-kit, Chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, analyzed that based on the current situation and reports, the fire likely originated from the ignition of scaffold nets, triggering a chain reaction. The bamboo scaffolding itself also caught fire, causing the blaze to escalate rapidly. He suggested that the final conclusion would depend on investigations by the Fire Services Department and the police.</p> 
<p>Chau explained that compliant flame-retardant scaffold nets are designed to effectively slow fire spread. However, <strong>he speculated that the nets used in this incident were either non-flame-retardant or had lost their flame-retardant properties.</strong> He also pointed out that <strong>construction waste or flammable materials stored on the scaffolding could have contributed to the severity of the No. 5 alarm fire</strong>.</p> 
<p>Some experts also attributed the fire's intensity to the dry weather and strong winds, which further fueled the flames.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Industry highlights regulatory loopholes, cost considerations may influence material choices</strong></p> 
<p>Ho Ping-tak, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union,&nbsp;expressed concern over whether flame-retardant nets were used on the exterior walls of the building. Speaking on a radio program today, Ho noted that <strong>flame-retardant nets are more expensive than standard non-flame-retardant nets, and it is possible that some individuals prioritized cost savings over safety regulations</strong>. He called on the government to strengthen oversight.</p> 
<p>Ho also pointed out that scaffolding was erected simultaneously across seven buildings, which allowed the fire to spread more easily. Additionally, he criticized the construction project for lasting over a year, which he deemed excessively long, adding that the consultancy firm overseeing the maintenance should bear responsibility.</p> 
<p>Lee&nbsp;Kwong-sing, Chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner, stated that <strong>while the Labour Department's industry guidelines recommend the use of flame-retardant nets, there is no legal requirement mandating their use.</strong> This regulatory gap fosters a sense of complacency within the industry. Lee shared that he has encountered construction sites using fishing nets as protective barriers.</p> 
<p>He also condemned <strong>the use of foam boards to seal ventilation openings</strong> in this incident, describing it as a grave mistake. Lee speculated that workers likely used the boards to prevent dust from entering indoor spaces, but emphasized that foam boards are highly flammable and pose a significant fire hazard. He criticized the lack of safety awareness among workers.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, Lee noted that maintenance sites often <strong>lack safety officers to oversee operations and do not enforce smoking bans</strong>. He observed that some workers smoke while working, underscoring the insufficiency of government and industry oversight.</p>
