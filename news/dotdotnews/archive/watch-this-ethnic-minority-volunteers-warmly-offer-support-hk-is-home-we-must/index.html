For him, Hong Kong has long become his second home. When he mentioned his desire to help, his wife encouraged him without hesitation, saying, \"Do your best to help others. I\'m proud of you!\" Her support has been his greatest motivation. \"We love Hong Kong and its people.

He admitted that rather than merely sharing information on social media, he preferred to be physically present to offer help. \"HK is my home, my life, my everything.\" He recalled a lesson his family taught him as a child: \"In good times, don\'t disturb others; in hard times, always lend a hand.\"<\/p> \n<figure class=\"image align-center\" style=\"display:table;\"> \n <img src=\"https://dams.dotdotnews.com/dams/product/image/202511/28/6929bd32e4b08c07fcb5ea17.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1200\" data-from=\"dams\" data-imgid=\"6929bd38e4b08c07fcb5ea18\" data-dams-storyid=\"po6929bdb1e4b08c07fcb5ea43\" data-mimetype=\"image/jpg\" data-resourcesrc=\"/product/image/202511/28/6929bd32e4b08c07fcb5ea17.jpg\" data-width=\"5712\" data-height=\"4284\" id=\"img-null\"> \n <figcaption style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;\">\n   A\xA0team of\xA0volunteers\xA0composed of ethnic minorities from Pakistan and India have\xA0purchased supplies like blankets, coffee, lemon tea, cakes, and other essentials out of their own pockets to distribute to residents in need.

<p>"We're always ready, 24 hours!" said Awan, a volunteer from Pakistan.</p> 
<p>Yesterday (Nov. 28), DotDotNews reporters encountered a group of volunteers near&nbsp;Wang Fuk Court. This team, composed of ethnic minorities from Pakistan and India, had purchased supplies like blankets, coffee, lemon tea, cakes, and other essentials out of their own pockets to distribute to residents in need.</p> 
<p>Awan, who has lived in Hong Kong for 15 years, expressed deep sadness upon hearing the news of the fire. "It's a feeling that's hard to put into words. I just wanted to take real action and do something for the affected residents," he said. "We prepared coffee, lemon tea, cakes, cookies, and brand-new clothes. Whenever there's a need, we are ready to distribute them without hesitation."</p>

<p>Awan particularly expressed gratitude for his family's unwavering support. His wife is a Hongkonger, and the couple has two children. For him, Hong Kong has long become his second home. When he mentioned his desire to help, his wife encouraged him without hesitation, saying, "Do your best to help others. I'm proud of you!" Her support has been his greatest motivation. "We love Hong Kong and its people. As long as there's a need here, we're always prepared and on standby 24/7, ready to help without hesitation."</p> 
<p>Another organizer of the volunteer team, Mantou, who is from India and has lived in HK for 20 years, shared similar sentiments. He admitted that rather than merely sharing information on social media, he preferred to be physically present to offer help. "HK is my home, my life, my everything." He recalled a lesson his family taught him as a child: "In good times, don't disturb others; in hard times, always lend a hand."</p>

<p>Mantou also addressed stereotypes about Indian communities in society. Using a vivid metaphor, he explained, "A hand has five fingers, all of different lengths. People are the same." He continued, "Maybe some people from our country have done bad things that created a negative impression of us, but not everyone is like that. In difficult times, we just want to help and contribute."</p>
