<p>A deadly No. 5 fire at Tai Po's Wang Fuk Court has gripped the hearts of people. Hong Kong enterprises and mainland enterprises in Hong Kong swiftly responded with disaster relief efforts yesterday, donating money, supplies, or manpower. According to incomplete statistics from Wen Wei Po, as of 9 p.m. last night (Nov. 27), total donations from various sectors for the affected residents had already exceeded HK$1 billion.</p> 
<p>Among them, The Hong Kong Jockey Club announced a donation of approximately HK$170 million. This includes disbursing emergency grants of HK$150,000 to the families of the deceased, HK$100,000 to the seriously injured, and HK$50,000 to those with minor injuries. It also provides subsidies and furniture for relocated families and those moving to transitional housing. The Lee Shau Kee Foundation, Wharf, Jack Ma Foundation, Tencent, HSBC and Hang Seng Bank, China Hongqiao Group, among others, each donated HK$30 million.</p> 
<p>The total donation amount continued to rise throughout the evening and cannot be fully listed here. Additionally, multiple companies provided free hotel rooms, supplies, and medical assistance, with all sectors uniting to support the affected residents in overcoming this difficult time.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Swift action from all sectors</strong></p> 
<p>The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust announced yesterday a HK$170 million donation. This includes the emergency grants mentioned above and support for relocation and furniture. Organizations and enterprises such as Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, Bank of China (Hong Kong), Ng Fung Hong, China Mobile Hong Kong,&nbsp;Hong Kong Jewelry Manufacturers' Association (HKJMA), the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations, and the Chaoren Association also donated money and supplies, and provided communication and emotional support, demonstrating the spirit of mutual assistance in Hong Kong society and jointly helping the affected residents.</p> 
<p>To address the incident, The Hong Kong Jockey Club announced yesterday it would provide HK$100 million in aid through its emergency relief fund to alleviate the urgent needs of the injured and families of the deceased, to be distributed through the Social Welfare Department and NGOs. The Jockey Club emphasized that it will provide further support in the future.</p> 
<p>The Club also stated it would donate the total proceeds from Sunday's race meeting to assist those affected, estimated at approximately HK$70 million. Combined with the initial HK$100 million donation, the total Jockey Club contribution will be around HK$170 million.</p> 
<p>The Club will also provide subsidies to operators of transitional housing for furniture purchases, enabling affected families to move in immediately: HK$18,000 for 1-2 person units and HK$20,000 for units for 3 or more people. Beyond emergency grants, the Jockey Club Charities Trust will collaborate closely with relevant government departments and NGOs to assist the next one to three months, including transitional housing, food aid, bereavement and emotional support, educational support, caregiver support, and emergency medicine distribution through community pharmacies under the "Jockey Club PHARM+ Community Medication Service Network."</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Federation of Fujian Associations raises HK$20.21 million for relief</strong></p> 
<p>Following the fire, the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations immediately initiated assistance measures and launched a specific fundraising drive. By 9 p.m. last night, they had raised HK$20.21 million. The Federation also actively assessed the situation of fellow Fujianese residents living in Wang Fuk Court and the surrounding area. Through the regional networks of its 273 affiliated societies, it proactively contacted affected fellow townspeople to provide timely assistance. Simultaneously, the Federation opened a support hotline (2566 1818) to fully assist affected citizens.</p>
