<p>Following the No. 5 fire at Tai Po's Wang Fuk Court, which caused severe casualties and displaced residents, numerous artists have stepped forward. Not only have they used their social media platforms to voice support and pray for the victims, actively sharing community support information to leverage their influence for faster dissemination, but artists like Han Hong, Cecilia Cheung, and Miriam Yeung have also made donations for disaster relief.</p> 
<p>Andy Lau wrote on his "Andy World Club" website: "I express my condolences to the victims of the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire and send my greetings to the other affected people. I wish the injured a speedy recovery. Wishing everyone safety and peace!" Aaron Kwok posted on social media: "God bless Wang Fuk Court! I wish the injured a speedy recovery, and may the deceased rest in peace. I pay tribute to all firefighters and ambulance personnel." Donnie Yen posted a candlelight photo in his Instagram story with the message: "God Bless Hong Kong!"</p> 
<p>Sam Hui, who has lived in Tai Po for many years, wrote a handwritten message on social media: "As a Tai Po resident, I feel deeply for everyone. I hope all sectors will support and focus on assisting the Fire Services Department with the rescue efforts. God bless Hong Kong!" Former Miss Hong Kong winner&nbsp;Lisa-Marie Tse had a more personal connection, having witnessed her grandmother's home being destroyed by the fire. She extended her deepest condolences and prayers to all the deceased, injured, and those who lost their homes.</p> 
<p>Joey Yung paid tribute to the brave firefighters, thanking them for their fearless efforts. She expressed the belief that everyone can surely join hands to overcome this difficult time. Her company, Emperor Entertainment Group, also posted a message mourning the firefighters who died in the line of duty and the residents who tragically passed away. Alex Fong prayed for the safety of the affected residents, firefighters, all rescue and support personnel, hoping the affected families can overcome this ordeal soon.</p> 
<p>Oscar-winning actress Michelle Yeoh, who has deep ties with Hong Kong, also posted prayers for the deceased and injured. She sincerely thanked the firefighters, rescue teams, and everyone who stepped forward to help during such a difficult time.</p> 
<p>Artists, including Kara Wai, Nicholas Tse, Zhou Shen, Shu Qi, Charmaine Sheh, Yang Mi, Song Yuqi, Bobby Au-Yeung, Rosina Lin, Elena Kong, Angie Chiu, Raymond Wong Ho-Yin, Selena Lee,&nbsp;Tavia Yeung, Samantha Ko, Joel Chan, Ruco Chan, Dicky Cheung, Alice Chan,&nbsp;Vic Teo,&nbsp;Kevin Liu, and&nbsp;Cilla Kung sent prayers and wishes for the safety of the people affected by the Hong Kong fire.</p> 
<p>To support Hong Kong's disaster relief, the Han Hong Foundation immediately initiated an emergency response, donating 10 million RMB for the settlement of vulnerable groups affected by the disaster. They will continue to provide follow-up support based on the progress of relief efforts, practically helping the affected compatriots alleviate their plight and rebuild their homes. Cecilia Cheung donated HK$1 million, specifically earmarked for emergency fire rescue, transitional settlement for affected residents, living supplies, and more, aiming to join hands and help each other overcome the difficulties.</p> 
<p>Miriam Yeung, who begins a series of six concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum tomorrow (Nov. 29), explained that after much consideration, and due to scheduling and production constraints making adjustments impossible, the concerts will proceed as scheduled. However, three adjustments have been made: cancelling the gifting of flower baskets, donating the proceeds from the first concert's revenue and all profits from merchandise, and adjusting the performance content.</p> 
<p>The Korean awards ceremony MAMA, held on Nov. 28 and 29 at the Kai Tak Sports Park Main Stadium in Hong Kong, also proceeded as scheduled. The organizers stated that as a mark of mourning, a moment of silence would be held during the event, along with a donation to support the affected families, using "support Hong Kong" as the event's theme to provide positive energy for the city.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, numerous stars shared community support information, including G.E.M., Karen Mok, Jackson Wang, Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung, Sammi Cheng, Linda Chung, Hins Cheung, Keung To, Anson Lo, and&nbsp;Gigi Yim, consolidating strength to help the affected residents through this difficult time.</p> 
<p>Benji Chiang went to a blood donation station yesterday morning, showcasing the compassion in the world. He revealed on social media that even before the blood station opened, over 50 people were already queuing to donate. Many, knowing they might have to wait two or three hours, still chose to stay, which greatly moved him, leading him to exclaim, "I love you all, Hong Kong people!"</p>
