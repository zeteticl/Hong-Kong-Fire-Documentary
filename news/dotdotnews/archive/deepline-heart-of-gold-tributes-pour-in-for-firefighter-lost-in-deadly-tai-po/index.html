As of today (Nov. 27), the fire has caused at least 55 fatalities,\xA0including the tragic death of a 37-year-old firefighter, surnamed Ho, who lost his life in the line of duty. Multiple departments of the SAR government expressed profound grief over the firefighter\'s sacrifice. Last night, the Fire Services Department\'s (FSD) Facebook page turned its profile and cover photos black and white.<\/p> \n<p>Many of Ho\'s colleagues posted tributes on social media, while a large number of citizens left messages on the FSD\'s social media pages, thanking the firefighters for their brave and selfless rescue efforts. Some rescued residents at the scene expressed their gratitude for the firefighters\' dedication to the public.<\/p> \n<p>Ho had been with the FSD for about nine years and was stationed at the Sha Tin Fire Station. He was responsible for operating small rescue vehicles and carrying out related firefighting and rescue missions. It is understood that before joining the FSD, Ho served as a police officer.<\/p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Lost contact half an hour after firefighting began<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>FSD Director\xA0Andy Yeung Yan-kin briefed the media on the rescue situation at the scene last night. According to him, Ho arrived at the scene at 3:01 PM as part of the first response team and was responsible for rescue operations on the ground floor. He lost contact around 3:30 PM and was found at 4:01 PM in an open area opposite an elevator. At that time, Ho was suffering from facial burns and was administered first aid by paramedics before being rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 4:45 PM.<\/p> \n<p>Yeung expressed that Ho had always been dedicated to his duties and performed bravely. He conveyed deep sorrow and regret over the loss of a loyal and duty-bound colleague, stating that \"the entire department is heartbroken.\" On behalf of all department staff, he extended deepest condolences to Ho\'s family. The FSD\'s welfare team and psychological counseling unit will provide comprehensive support to the family.<\/p> \n<p>Secretary for Security Chris Tang expressed profound grief over the firefighter\'s death and extended condolences to the families of other victims of the fire. He also wished a speedy recovery to the injured. Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid\xA0Yeung\xA0paid tribute to Ho\'s brave actions and selfless dedication, expressing the highest respect on behalf of the civil service. She conveyed deepest condolences to his family and stated that the Civil Service Bureau has contacted the FSD and will do its utmost to assist Ho\'s family through this sad and difficult time.<\/p> \n<p>Ho\'s colleagues posted a graduation photo from their fire academy days on social media in the evening to mourn their fallen comrade.<\/p> \n<p><strong>\"We will not forget you. Thank you for giving your all for us. You\'re off duty now, rest well...\"<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>The firefighter who left the message said that he and all the brothers are proud of Ho.<\/p> \n<p>Additionally, when Ho was sent to the hospital, he was wearing the fireproof protective suit commonly known as the \"golden battle suit,\" but he was already unconscious and severely blackened by smoke. Nip Yuen-fung, Vice Chairman of the Fire Services Department Staffs General Association, r<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">esponded<\/span>\xA0to inquiries from Ta Kung Pao, stating that the cause of the incident is still under investigation. He expressed sadness over the death of a colleague and noted that while the \"golden battle suit\" has high-temperature resistance, the fire scene had heavy smoke, sustained high temperatures, and a rapidly changing environment, presenting various challenges to firefighters.<\/p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The fearless<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>The reporter at the scene witnessed multiple smoke helmet teams, consisting of about ten members each, carrying heavy oxygen tanks and firefighting equipment, using powerful flashlights, and marching with determined steps as they filed into the continuously burning, fiercely blazing fireground.<\/p> \n<p>Soon, these fearless warriors disappeared into the dark building. Subsequently, the strong beams of searchlights could be seen flashing constantly within the floors. At the scene, burning structures and scaffolding kept collapsing, explosions were frequent, and fiery debris flew everywhere.<\/p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>18 residents rescued in less than 2 hours<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>\"Quick!

<p>A No. 5 alarm fire broke out yesterday (Nov. 26) at&nbsp;Wang Fuk Court&nbsp;in Tai Po. As of today (Nov. 27), the fire has caused at least 55 fatalities,&nbsp;including the tragic death of a 37-year-old firefighter, surnamed Ho, who lost his life in the line of duty. Multiple departments of the SAR government expressed profound grief over the firefighter's sacrifice. Last night, the Fire Services Department's (FSD) Facebook page turned its profile and cover photos black and white.</p> 
<p>Many of Ho's colleagues posted tributes on social media, while a large number of citizens left messages on the FSD's social media pages, thanking the firefighters for their brave and selfless rescue efforts. Some rescued residents at the scene expressed their gratitude for the firefighters' dedication to the public.</p> 
<p>Ho had been with the FSD for about nine years and was stationed at the Sha Tin Fire Station. He was responsible for operating small rescue vehicles and carrying out related firefighting and rescue missions. It is understood that before joining the FSD, Ho served as a police officer.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lost contact half an hour after firefighting began</strong></p> 
<p>FSD Director&nbsp;Andy Yeung Yan-kin briefed the media on the rescue situation at the scene last night. According to him, Ho arrived at the scene at 3:01 PM as part of the first response team and was responsible for rescue operations on the ground floor. He lost contact around 3:30 PM and was found at 4:01 PM in an open area opposite an elevator. At that time, Ho was suffering from facial burns and was administered first aid by paramedics before being rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 4:45 PM.</p> 
<p>Yeung expressed that Ho had always been dedicated to his duties and performed bravely. He conveyed deep sorrow and regret over the loss of a loyal and duty-bound colleague, stating that "the entire department is heartbroken." On behalf of all department staff, he extended deepest condolences to Ho's family. The FSD's welfare team and psychological counseling unit will provide comprehensive support to the family.</p> 
<p>Secretary for Security Chris Tang expressed profound grief over the firefighter's death and extended condolences to the families of other victims of the fire. He also wished a speedy recovery to the injured. Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid&nbsp;Yeung&nbsp;paid tribute to Ho's brave actions and selfless dedication, expressing the highest respect on behalf of the civil service. She conveyed deepest condolences to his family and stated that the Civil Service Bureau has contacted the FSD and will do its utmost to assist Ho's family through this sad and difficult time.</p> 
<p>Ho's colleagues posted a graduation photo from their fire academy days on social media in the evening to mourn their fallen comrade.</p> 
<p><strong>"We will not forget you. Thank you for giving your all for us. You're off duty now, rest well..."</strong></p> 
<p>The firefighter who left the message said that he and all the brothers are proud of Ho.</p> 
<p>Additionally, when Ho was sent to the hospital, he was wearing the fireproof protective suit commonly known as the "golden battle suit," but he was already unconscious and severely blackened by smoke. Nip Yuen-fung, Vice Chairman of the Fire Services Department Staffs General Association, r<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">esponded</span>&nbsp;to inquiries from Ta Kung Pao, stating that the cause of the incident is still under investigation. He expressed sadness over the death of a colleague and noted that while the "golden battle suit" has high-temperature resistance, the fire scene had heavy smoke, sustained high temperatures, and a rapidly changing environment, presenting various challenges to firefighters.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The fearless</strong></p> 
<p>The reporter at the scene witnessed multiple smoke helmet teams, consisting of about ten members each, carrying heavy oxygen tanks and firefighting equipment, using powerful flashlights, and marching with determined steps as they filed into the continuously burning, fiercely blazing fireground.</p> 
<p>Soon, these fearless warriors disappeared into the dark building. Subsequently, the strong beams of searchlights could be seen flashing constantly within the floors. At the scene, burning structures and scaffolding kept collapsing, explosions were frequent, and fiery debris flew everywhere.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>18 residents rescued in less than 2 hours</strong></p> 
<p>"Quick! Get the paramedics, we have a casualty coming out!" Amid the chaotic scene, shouts from firefighters could be heard frequently. Reporters at the scene continuously witnessed residents trapped in the fire being rescued. Some casualties, when carried out, had severely blackened faces and were already unconscious; some were semi-conscious; others required continuous CPR from paramedics while being transported to the hospital.</p> 
<p>Some casualties were carried out of the fireground in the arms of firefighters and handed over to paramedics. Most touching was the sight of four elderly men and women, some leaning on walking sticks, being supported by fire crew members, step by step, walking out of the fireground before being sent to the hospital for treatment. Based on a rough count by reporters, from around 8:00 PM to nearly 10:00 PM, from the parking lot location where the reporter was stationed, 18 residents were rescued.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Journalist's View | Heart of gold</strong></p> 
<p><em>By Darius</em></p> 
<p>A line from a movie goes: "In life, nothing matters except death." For the multitude of living beings, life is the most precious thing. Although some may claim not to fear death, when faced with a threat to life, the instinct of all living creatures is a deep, bone-chilling fear. Precisely because life is both fragile and precious, those who give their lives for duty and responsibility appear exceptionally noble.</p> 
<p>Yes, I know some will say that saving lives and rescuing the injured is the duty of firefighters and similar professions. But let us search our hearts and ask ourselves: if we encountered danger, could we still charge forward without hesitation? There are no fireproof supermen in this world, only ordinary people who step forward. Knowing the potential cost could be their lives, yet still choosing to fulfill their duties faithfully – this firefighter truly possessed a heart of gold.</p> 
<p>Of course, I am not saying that every firefighter must achieve such self-sacrifice for others; although this deed is worth celebrating, we cannot demand that everyone reach this standard. After all, no one is truly "obligated" to sacrifice for a greater cause. <strong>What I contemplate are the matters following the hero's death; may he become a monument in history, and may his relatives receive the shelter and care of society.</strong></p>
